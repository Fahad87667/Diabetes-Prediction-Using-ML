# Diabetes Prediction using SVM

This project implements a Diabetes Prediction system using Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning. The system is designed to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on various input features.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: This file contains the Flask web application for user interaction.
- `Diabetes_model.pkl`: The trained SVM model saved using pickle.
- `diabetes.csv`: The dataset used for training the machine learning model.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-diabetes-prediction-project.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage

Input the required features (e.g., pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure) in the provided form.
Click the "Predict" button to get the prediction result.
The prediction result will be displayed on the webpage.
